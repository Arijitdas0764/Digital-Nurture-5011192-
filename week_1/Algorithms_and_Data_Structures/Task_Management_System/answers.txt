o	Explain the different types of linked lists (Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List).

ans: Linked lists are linear data structures with nodes that store data along with a reference to the next node (or previous node in the case of a doubly linked list). There are two main types of linked lists:
Singly Linked List: Each node contains a value and a reference to the next node. The last node has a null reference.
Doubly Linked List: Each node contains a value and two references: one to the next node and one to the previous node.


o	Analyze the time complexity of each operation.

ans: Add: O(1)
Search: O(n), where n is the number of tasks in the list.
Traverse: O(n), where n is the number of tasks in the list.
Delete: O(n), where n is the number of tasks in the list.



o	Discuss the advantages of linked lists over arrays for dynamic data.

ans: Better dynamic memory management for insertions and deletions.
No need to shift elements for insertions and deletions.
Easier implementation of dynamic data structures like stacks, queues, and linked lists compared to arrays.
